/**
 * Every agent under way, the reservation table, and the tick that arbitrates between
 * them. Spec 2026-09-06 2.2, 3.
 *
 * Pattern: Mediator - the one UAirsideTraffic was, moved down a layer. It moved because the
 * milestone's three tests ("two agents converge on a node; one yields", and the rest) must
 * run with NewObject and no world, and every multi-agent test before this one had to
 * UWorld::CreateWorld because the agent list lived in Present/ beside its view pointers.
 * Free functions over a hand-built agent array were considered and rejected: the ORDER of
 * claims is what makes aircraft-over-vehicle true, and a test that built its own order
 * would not be testing the tick.
 *
 * An agent's journey is a handover between the runway, the taxi route and the stand it ends
 * at, and something has to own the list of who is mid-journey without being the graph itself
 * (an agent is a thing part way through a trip, not a fact about the airport - see Agents
 * below) or the mesh (agents share no geometry with the pavement they drive on). This class
 * is that something.
 *
 * WORLD-FREE. The network is passed to Advance per call and never held, so this object
 * cannot outlive the graph it arbitrates over and needs nothing from an actor.
 *
 * A UObject rather than a USTRUCT so the table and the agents are GC-visible UPROPERTYs
 * on something UAirsideTraffic can own by CreateDefaultSubobject, and so a test can
 * NewObject one. Transient throughout: agents never reach disk (see Agents).
